# chomper_css
chomper implemented with CSS animations

## Goal
I'm reimplementing my original js code with some css animations, just to see how those work comparitively.

## Installation
It's one html file with css inline.  Yeah, that's ugly, I know.  Easier for a repository like this, though!

## Future plans
* the little guy needs a mouth!  He's like Hello Kitty!
* The code should sense the size of the window.  
* or perhaps I'll turn it into a set of googly eyes that follow the mouse?
* I may have pushed this as far as it can/should go?
